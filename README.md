Ctrl+s

This extension adds the Ctrl+S shortcut to every Control Panel Page. Hitting the Ctrl+S key combo does exactly what most applications do - saves! In this case is actually hits the update/save button - saving you time.

Tested in Chrome, IE10, Safari and Firefox. 

Works in the following areas:
Templates,
Channel Entries
Snippets
Pretty much anywhere there is a save or update button

Added Mac support but needs testing - and i dont have a mac.. :(
